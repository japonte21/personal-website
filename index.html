        About Me
      </span>
      <p class="section-text">
        I am a senior at Williams College, double majoring in Computer Science and Studio
        Art, with a concentration in Latina/o Studies. I am primarily interested in
        software engineering, developing application software, and generally learning how
        a programming language works. I'm currently learning how to work on editing websites
        using HTML and CSS, but I also have experience with content management systems,
        such as WordPress. After graduation, I hope to work with a company to create new
        tools that can be useful for everyday life by creating implementations for things
        that may not seem connected to coding.
      </p>
      <p class="section-text">
        Aside from computer science, I use a lot of my free time to develop my art skills
        in different mediums, primarily photography and drawing. While on campus, I
        participate in an West African drum and dance group called Kusika, as well as
        volunteer to help with a first-year orientation group focused on identity,
        sustainability, and social justice, called Root.

            "Do the Math" Programming Language - F#
          </span>
          <span class="project-description">
            Do the Math (DTM) is a simple specialized programming language made to
            simulate how other languages work using parsers and evaluators. It includes a
            REPL, supports file input, and focuses on computing math expressions in prefix
            and infix notation.

            Exam Scheduler - Java
          </span>
          <span class="project-description">
            This program uses a weighted graph and a greedy sorting algorithm to schedule
            exams based on a list of students’ schedules. It creates an optimized schedule
            for any list of students to prevent back-to-back time slots.

            Hash Table Statistics - Java
          </span>
          <span class="project-description">
            This program implements a hash table to compute statistics on a data set of
            3,000+ movies. It provided constant search time for information on the movies
            that the website, Rotten Tomatoes, provides.

            Cache Memory Simulator - C
          </span>
          <span class="project-description">
            This program simulates the hit/miss behavior of cache memory using the LRU
            replacement policy. It dynamically creates the cache based on any size that
            was requested by the user.
